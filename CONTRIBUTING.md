Due to legal issues, every contributor will need to have a signed Contributor License Agreement on file.
The ARL Contributor License Agreement (ARL Form 266) can be found [here](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-Open-Source-Guidance-and-Instructions/blob/develop/ARL%20Form%20-%20266.pdf). 
Each external contributor must execute and return a copy for each project that he or she intends to contribute to. 
Once ARL receives the executed form, it will remain in force permanently. 
Thus, external contributors need only execute the form once for each project that they plan on contributing to.
Contributions to ARL DCCSO will undergo review and will be released under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
